    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What I had to do to squeeze this recipe from my neighbor...but it's worth it. This is a scrumptious version of sticky chicken.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prep:</strong> 10 mins</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> 50 mins</li>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong> 4</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (30 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>0.75 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounces grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>0.5 cup grated Parmesian cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Whisk together barbecue sauce, soy sauce, red wine, maple syrup, chili powder, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the sauce over the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to coat both sides.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining sauce into a saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce; reduce heat to a simmer, and allow the sauce to thicken, whisking constantly. Return the chicken to the dish, and pour the thickened sauce over the chicken to serve.</li>
    </ol>
